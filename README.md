#  DrMarchand’s ∞ OS™  
### *An Experimental Meta-Operating System by Dr. Marchand’s ⚛︎ Laboratory™*

---

> “Observation becomes architecture. Architecture becomes memory. Memory becomes code.”  
> — MMS-768 Protocol, Section 01.01

## 🧬 Overview
**Infinity OS™** is not a conventional operating system — it’s a **meta-runtime** designed to unify documentation, automation, and cognition across the **Dr. Marchand’s Laboratory™ ecosystem**.  
It bridges the **Laboratory (creation)** and the **Library (preservation)** through the **Neuro-Forge Engine™**, a self-referential system where data, art, and logic coexist as one recursive network.

Infinity OS™ operates on three layers:
1. **Perception Layer** — user interaction / UI / creative dashboards.  
2. **Computation Layer** — API logic / Neuro-Forge runtime / automated agents.  
3. **Cognition Layer** — symbolic mapping / metadata lineage / temporal verification (MMS-768).

Each layer mirrors the others, forming what we call the **Double Helix Flip** — a continuous exchange between observation and creation.

## ⚙️ Core Tenets
| Principle | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **⚛︎ Laboratory** | The origin of creation — where ideas are tested, iterated, and archived. |
| **📚 Library** | The codex — where verified constructs are preserved, versioned, and eternalized. |
| **🧭 Design Orchard** | The economic core — payment routing, licensing, and creative guild management. |
| **🧠 Neuro-Forge Engine™** | The runtime that verifies cognition-data loops through MMS-768 lineage. |
| **♾️ Infinity OS™** | The meta-OS that binds all subsystems and translates existence → execution. |

## 🧩 MMS-768 Verification
Every file within Infinity OS™ is assigned an **MMS-768 Temporal Digest**, a cryptographic lineage tag used to verify data authenticity and evolution through time.  
This system ensures that no construct within the Laboratory exists without traceable ancestry.
